# google_homepage
My attempt at creating a Google Homepage, as an assignment for the Odin Project.

## Reflections
After spending a day to create this simple Google Homepage, I would like to share what I've learnt. 

I've learnt how to code out simple webpages based on HTML and CSS. I had some understanding of HTML and CSS, but it's the first
time I actually completed some HTML and CSS tutorials and took the time to understand what I was doing.  

Initially I did not structure my HTML properly, which made it hard to style the elements with CSS. 
Through this mini project, I realised the importance of structuring HTML properly. 

I also learnt how to use Chrome DevTools to code out what it looks like in the browser. This is the first time 
I've used DevTools in depth, and I'm quite amazed at what it can do for front end developers. 

Overall, I'm quite happy with what I've created so far, though I'm aware that there are many points for improvement.

## Future improvements
Some possible features I could add:
* Make the searching lead to a Google search result page. 
* Refine the UI of the components
* Internationalise the page by changing the language in the buttons
* Make the web page responsive
